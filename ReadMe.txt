Hello, everyone. This is a repository for Active Control Gate Theory.

2021/9/21:
Upload the v1.0 of the Verilog code.
It realize the ADDA process and finally output the disered waveform.
wave generator Frequency:1kHz Amplitude:5V Resistence:50ohm
2021/9/22:
Upload the v1.1 of the Verilog code.
It will shrink the three voltage level duration.
wave generator Frequency:1kHz Amplitude:5V Resistence:50ohm
