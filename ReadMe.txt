Hello, everyone. This is a repository for Active Control Gate Theory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/9/21:
Upload the v1.0 of the AC_SICMOS code.
It realize the ADDA process and finally output the disered waveform.
wave generator Frequency:1kHz Amplitude:5V Resistence:50ohm Type:Square wave

2021/9/22:
Upload the v1.1 of the AC_SICMOS code.
It will shrink the three voltage level duration.
wave generator Frequency:1kHz Amplitude:5V Resistence:50ohm Type:Square wave

2021/9/27:
Upload the v1.0 of the TEST_ADDA code.
It test the ADDA process which outputs the input waves(AD:25MHz, DA:100MHz).
1 channel of the ADC;1 channel of the DAC.
wave generator Frequency:500kHz Amplitude:5V Resistence:50ohm Type:Sawtooth wave
P.S. The delay of the Phosphor ZYNQ board with its ADDA board is 235ns.

2021/9/30
Upload the v1.0 of the AC_SICMOS_Testdidt code.
It will be the last test of the whole test proess.
wave generator Frequency:1kHz High voltage:2.662V Low voltage:-2.362V Resistence:50ohm Type:Arbitrary wave Filename:didt.tfw

2021/10/01
Upload the v2.0 of the TEST_ADDA code.
It test the ADDA process which outputs the input waves(AD:25MHz, DA:100MHz).
1 channel of the ADC;3 channels of the DAC.
wave generator Frequency:1kHz High voltage:2.662V Low voltage:-2.362V Resistence:50ohm Type:Arbitrary wave Filename:didt.tfw

2021/10/03
Upload the v2.0 of the AC_SICMOS_Testdidt code.
It will be the last test of the whole test proess.
